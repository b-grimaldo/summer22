      Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, 
      the Gal√°pagos penguin, is found north of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming.
