      Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, 
      the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. The distinctive features of all elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, 
      tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin.
