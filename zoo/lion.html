      The lion is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. 
      It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. Even though the lion is sometimes referred to as the “king of the jungle,” 
      it actually only lives in grasslands and plains.
